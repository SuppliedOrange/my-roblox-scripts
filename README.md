Roblox scripts for education purposes

Hi, this is a collection of scripts that I have developed for the sake of education. Please do NOT use these scripts for unethical purposes.
You may pick, dissect and learn from them.

These scripts are provided "as is", with no warranty or guarantee of safety.
The author is not responsible for any bans or damages resulting from its use.

## How I made this:

I have never made a game on roblox nor have I programmed with lua. LLMs helped me generate and learn a lot.
I would highly recommend using them, especially if you're new to reverse engineering.

If you're in a roblox game and you have no idea what objects you can manipulate, please check out InfiniteYield.
They have a command called "dex" which spawns an explorer for you to see objects and scripts of the game with.
InfiniteYield also has a lot of other useful commands for development

Additionally, the [Roblox Developer Documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting) helps understand what functions return,
how they can be used and more. It was especially useful for me since I made extensive use of [Remote Events](https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting/events/remote#remote-events)
in my very first mod.

Happy learning!
